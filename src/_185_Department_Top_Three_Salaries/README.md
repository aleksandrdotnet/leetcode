[185. Department Top Three Salaries](https://leetcode.com/problems/department-top-three-salaries/description/)

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high
earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

## Example 1

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+

Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+

Output:
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation:
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees
```

## Code

```tsql
-- Implementation #1
with CTE AS (
select
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dep.id ORDER BY emp.salary DESC) [Rank],
    dep.name [Department],
    emp.name [Employee],
    emp.salary [Salary]
from
    Department dep
    inner join Employee emp on dep.Id = emp.departmentId
)

select Department, Employee, Salary
from CTE
where Rank <= 3

-- Implementation #2
SELECT
    d.name AS Department,
    e.name AS Employee,
    e.salary AS Salary
FROM Department d
         LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        emp.departmentId,
        emp.name,
        emp.salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY emp.departmentId
            ORDER BY emp.salary DESC
            ) AS dr
    FROM Employee emp
) e ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE e.dr <= 3;

-- Implementation #3
SELECT
    d.name AS Department,
    o1.name AS Employee,
    o1.salary AS Salary
FROM Department d
         OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT
        emp.departmentId,
        emp.name,
        emp.salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY emp.salary DESC) AS dr
    FROM Employee emp
    WHERE emp.departmentId = d.id
) o1
WHERE o1.dr <= 3;
