[238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

```
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
```

## Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

## Example 2

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

## Constraints

```
2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
```

## Code

```csharp

```

## Follow up

Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity?
(The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## Complexity

> **Time complexity**: O()  
> **Space complexity**: O()
