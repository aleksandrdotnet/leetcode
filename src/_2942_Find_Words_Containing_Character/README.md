[2942. Find Words Containing Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-containing-character/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-24)

```
You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.

Note that the returned array may be in any order.
```

## Example 1

```
Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
```

## Example 2

```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
```

## Example 3

```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
```

## Constraints

```
1 <= words.length <= 50
1 <= words[i].length <= 50
x is a lowercase English letter.
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
```

## Code

```csharp
public IList<int> FindWordsContaining(string[] words, char x)
{
    var result = new List<int>();

    for (var i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
    {
        foreach (var c in words[i])
        {
            if (c == x)
            {
                result.Add(i);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```
