[1174. Immediate Food Delivery II](https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```
Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.
```

Example 1:

Input: 
Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
Output: 
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 50.00                |
+----------------------+
Explanation: 
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.
```

## Code

```tsql
;WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        d.customer_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY d.customer_id ORDER BY d.order_date asc) AS row_num,
        CASE
            WHEN d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 'immediate'
            ELSE 'scheduled'
            END AS sc
    FROM
        Delivery d
)
 select
     round(sum(iif(c.sc = 'immediate', 1, 0)) * 100.0/count(1),2) [immediate_percentage]
 from
     cte c
 where
     c.row_num = 1
