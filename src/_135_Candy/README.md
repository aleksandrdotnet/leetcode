[135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-06-02)

```
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
```

## Example 1
```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

## Example 2
```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

## Constraints
```
n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4
```

## Code
```csharp
public int Candy(int[] ratings) {
    int n = ratings.Length;
    int[] candies = new int[n];
    Array.Fill(candies, 1);

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
            candies[i] = Math.Max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
        }
    }

    int totalCandies = 0;
    foreach (int candy in candies) {
        totalCandies += candy;
    }

    return totalCandies;
}
```
